        <h1>Grid template areas</h1>
        <p>In the previous guide we looked at grid lines, and how to position items against those lines. When you use CSS Grid Layout you always have lines, and this can be a straightforward way to place items on your grid. However, there is an alternate method to use for positioning items on the grid which you can use alone or in combination with line-based placement. This method involves placing our items using named template areas, and we will find out exactly how this method works. You will see very quickly why we sometimes call this the ascii-art method of grid layout!</p>

                <h2>Naming a grid area</h2>
            </header>
            <p>You have already encountered the grid-area property. This is the property that can take as a value all four of the lines used to position a grid area.</p>
            <p>What we are doing here when defining all four lines, is defining the area by specifying the lines that enclose that area.</p>
            <p>We can also define an area by giving it a name and then specify the location of that area in the value of the grid-template-areas property. You can choose what you would like to name your area.</p>
            <p>Instead of placing my items using line numbers specified on the items themselves, I create the whole layout on the grid container.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
                <div class="header">Header</div>
                <div class="sidebar">Sidebar</div>
                <div class="content">Content</div>
                <div class="footer">Footer</div>
            </div>
            <p>Using this method we do not need to specify anything at all on the individual grid items, everything happens on our grid container. We can see the layout described as the value of the grid-template-areas property.</p>

        <section class="empty-grid-cell">
            <header>
                <h2>Leaving a grid cell empty</h2>
            </header>
            <p>We have completely filled our grid with areas in this example, leaving no white space. However you can leave grid cells empty with this method of layout. To leave a cell empty use the full stop character, '.'. If I want to only display the footer directly under the main content I would need to leave the three cells underneath the sidebar empty.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
                <div class="header">Header</div>
                <div class="sidebar">Sidebar</div>
                <div class="content">Content</div>
                <div class="footer">Footer</div>
            </div>

        <section class="span-multiple-cells">
            <header>
                <h2>Spanning multiple cells</h2>
            </header>
            <p>In our example each of the areas spans multiple grid cells and we achieve this by repeating the name of that grid area multiple times with white space between. You can add extra white space in order to keep your columns neatly lined up in the value of grid-template-areas. You can see that I have done this in order that the hd and ft line up with main.</p>
            <p>The area that you create by chaining the area names must be rectangular, at this point there is no way to create an L-shaped area. The specification does note that a future level might provide this functionality. You can however span rows just as easily as columns. For example we could make our sidebar span down to the end of the footer by replacing the . with sd.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
                <div class="header">Header</div>
                <div class="sidebar">Sidebar</div>
                <div class="content">Content</div>
                <div class="footer">Footer</div>
            </div>
            <p>The value of grid-template-areas must show a complete grid, otherwise it is invalid (and the property is ignored). This means that you must have the same number of cells for each row, if empty with a full stop character demonstrating that the cell is to be left empty. You will also create an invalid grid if your areas are not rectangular.</p>

            <header>
                <h2>Redefining the grid using media queries</h2>
                <p>As our layout is now contained in one part of the CSS, this makes it very easy to make changes at different breakpoints. You can do this by redefining the grid, the position of items on the grid, or both at once.</p>
                <p>When doing this, define the names for your areas outside of any media queries. That way the content area would always be called main no matter where on the grid it is placed.</p>
                <p>For our layout above, we might like to have a very simple layout at narrow widths, defining a single column grid and stacking up our items.</p>
                <p>We can then redefine that layout inside media queries to go to our two columns layout, and perhaps take it to a three column layout if the available space is even wider. Note that for the wide layout I keep my nine column track grid, I redefine where items are placed using grid-template-areas.</p>

        <section class="ui-elements">
            <header>
                <h2>Using grid-template-areas for UI elements</h2>
                <p>Many of the grid examples you will find online make the assumption that you will use grid for main page layout, however grid can be just as useful for small elements as those larger ones. Using grid-template-areas can be especially nice as it is easy to see in the code what your element looks like.</p>
                <p>As a very simple example we can create a “media object”. This is a component with space for an image or other media on one side and content on the other. The image might be displayed on the right or left of the box.</p>
                <p>Our grid is a two-column track grid, with the column for the image sized at 1fr and the text 3fr. If you wanted a fixed width image area, then you could set the image column as a pixel width, and assign the text area 1fr. A single column track of 1fr would then take up the rest of the space.</p>
                <p>We give the image area a grid area name of img and the text area content, then we can lay those out using the grid-template-areas property.</p>
                <div class="media">
                    <div class="image"></div>
                    <div class="text">This is a media object example. We can use grid-template-areas to switch around the image and text part of the media object. </div>
                </div>
                <div class="media flipped">
                    <div class="image"></div>
                    <div class="text">This is a media object example. We can use grid-template-areas to switch around the image and text part of the media object. </div>
