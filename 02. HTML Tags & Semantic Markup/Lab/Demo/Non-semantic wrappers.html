            or don't want to add any specific meaning. For example: -->
        <p>The King walked drunkenly back to his room at 01:00, the beer doing nothing to aid
                him as he staggered through the door <span class="editor-note">[Editor's note: At this point in the
                play, the lights should be down low]</span>.</p>
        <!--<div> is a block level non-semantic element, which you should only use if you can't think of a better semantic block element to use, or 
        don't want to add any specific meaning. For example, imagine a shopping cart widget that you could choose to pull up at any point during your 
        time on an e-commerce site: -->
        <!--Warning: Divs are so convenient to use that it's easy to use them too much. As they carry no semantic value, they just clutter your HTML code. 
        Take care to use them only when there is no better semantic solution and try to reduce their usage to the minimum otherwise you'll have a hard 
        time updating and maintaining your documents. -->
