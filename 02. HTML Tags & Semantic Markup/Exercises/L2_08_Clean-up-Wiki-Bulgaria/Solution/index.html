    <p><b>Bulgaria</b> (<a>/bʌlˈɡɛəriə, <wbr>bʊl-/</a><small class="nowrap">&nbsp;(<a></a><a>listen</a>)</small>; <a>Bulgarian</a>: България, <small><a>tr.</a></small> <i><i lang="bg-Latn" title="Bulgarian-language transliteration">Bǎlgariya</i></i>), officially the <b>Republic of Bulgaria</b> (Bulgarian: Република България, <small>tr.</small> <i><i lang="bg-Latn" title="Bulgarian-language transliteration">Republika Bǎlgariya</i></i>, <small>IPA:&nbsp;</small><a>[rɛˈpublikɐ bɐɫˈɡarijɐ]</a>), is a country in <a>Southeast Europe</a>. It is bordered by <a>Romania</a> to the north, <a>Serbia</a> and <a>Macedonia</a> to the west, <a>Greece</a> and <a>Turkey</a> to the south, and the <a>Black Sea</a> to the east. The capital and largest city is <a>Sofia</a>; other major cities are <a>Plovdiv</a>, <a>Varna</a> and <a>Burgas</a>. With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres (42,855&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), Bulgaria is Europe's <a>16th-largest country</a>. </p><p>One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the <a>Neolithic</a> <a>Karanovo culture</a>, which dates back to 6,500 BC. In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for <a>Thracians</a>, <a>Persians</a>, <a>Celts</a> and <a>ancient Macedonians</a>; stability came when the <a>Roman Empire</a> conquered the region in AD 45. The Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire lost some of these territories to an invading <a>Bulgar</a> horde in the late 7th century. The Bulgars founded the <a>First Bulgarian Empire</a> in AD 681, which dominated most of the <a>Balkans</a> and significantly influenced <a>Slavic</a> cultures by developing the <a>Cyrillic script</a>. This state lasted until the early 11th century, when Byzantine emperor <a>Basil II</a> conquered and dismantled it. A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a <a>Second Bulgarian Empire</a>, which reached its apex under <a>Ivan Asen II</a> (1218–1241). After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife, the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under <a>Ottoman</a> rule for nearly five centuries. </p>
    <p>The <a>Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78</a> resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State. Many ethnic Bulgarian populations were left outside its borders, which led to several conflicts with its neighbours and an alliance with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 Bulgaria became a <a>one-party socialist state</a> and part of the Soviet-led <a>Eastern Bloc</a>. The ruling <a>Communist Party</a> gave up its monopoly on power after the <a>revolutions of 1989</a> and allowed <a>multi-party</a> elections. Bulgaria then transitioned into a <a>democracy</a> and a market-based economy. </p>
    <p>Since adopting a democratic constitution in 1991, the <a>sovereign state</a> has been a <a>unitary</a> <a>parliamentary republic</a> with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation. The population of seven million lives mainly in Sofia and the capital cities of the <a>27 provinces</a>, and the country has suffered significant demographic decline since the late 1980s. </p>
    <p>Bulgaria is a member of the <a>European Union</a>, <a>NATO</a>, and the <a>Council of Europe</a>; it is a founding state of the <a>Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE) and has taken a seat on the <a>UN Security Council</a> three times. Its <a>market economy</a> is part of the <a>European Single Market</a> and mostly relies on services, followed by industry—especially machine building and mining—and agriculture. <a>Widespread corruption</a> is a major socioeconomic issue. </p>
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>The name <i>Bulgaria</i> is derived from the <i><a>Bulgars</a></i>, a tribe of <a>Turkic</a> origin that founded the country. Their name is not completely understood and difficult to trace back earlier than the 4th century AD,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGolden1992103–104_10-0" class="reference"><a>[7]</a></sup> but it is possibly derived from the <a>Proto-Turkic</a> word <i>bulģha</i> ("to mix", "shake", "stir") and its derivative <i>bulgak</i> ("revolt", "disorder").<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a>[8]</a></sup> The meaning may be further extended to "rebel", "incite" or "produce a state of disorder", i.e. the "disturbers".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChen201297_12-0" class="reference"><a>[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a>[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGolden1992104_14-0" class="reference"><a>[11]</a></sup> Ethnic groups in <a>Inner Asia</a> with phonologically similar names were frequently described in similar terms: during the 4th century, the <a>Buluoji</a>, a component of the "<a>Five Barbarian</a>" groups in Ancient China, were portrayed as both a "mixed race" and "troublemakers".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChen201292–95,_97_15-0" class="reference"><a>[12]</a></sup> </p>

    <p>As Ottoman power began to wane, <a>Habsburg Austria</a> and Russia saw Bulgarian Christians as potential allies.

    <h3>Third Bulgarian state</h3> <p>The <a>Treaty of San Stefano</a> was signed on 3 March 1878 by <a>Russia</a> and the <a>Ottoman Empire</a>.

It was superseded by the <a>Treaty of Berlin</a>, signed on 13 July, which provided for a much smaller state only comprising Moesia and the region of <a>Sofia</a>, leaving large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the new country.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESan_Stefano,_Berlin_and_Independence_75-1" class="reference"><a>[72]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-BBCProfile_77-0" class="reference"><a>[74]</a></sup> This significantly contributed to Bulgaria's militaristic foreign affairs approach during the first half of the 20th century.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHistorical_Setting_78-0" class="reference"><a>[75]</a></sup> </p>

After a disastrous defeat in the <a>Second Balkan War</a>, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the <a>Central Powers</a> in World War I.

The war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed.<sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a>[80]</a></sup> More than 253,000 refugees from the lost territories <a>immigrated</a> to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929,<sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a>[81]</a></sup> placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.<sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a>[82]</a></sup> </p>
    <p>The resulting political unrest led to the establishment of a royal <a>authoritarian dictatorship</a> by Tsar <a>Boris III</a> (1918–1943). Bulgaria entered World War II in 1941 as a member of <a>the Axis</a> but declined to participate in <a>Operation Barbarossa</a> and <a>saved its Jewish population</a> from deportation to <a>concentration camps</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBulgaria_in_World_War_II:_The_Passive_Alliance_86-0" class="reference"><a>[83]</a></sup> The sudden death of Boris III in mid-1943 pushed the country into political turmoil as the war turned against Germany, and the communist guerrilla movement gained momentum. The government of <a>Bogdan Filov</a> subsequently failed to achieve peace with the Allies.
