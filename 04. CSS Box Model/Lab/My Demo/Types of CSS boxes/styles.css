        (i.e. it will appear on the same line as surrounding text and other inline elements, 
        and its content will break with the flow of the text, like lines of text in a paragraph.) 
        Width and height settings have no effect on inline boxes; any padding, margin and 
        border set on inline boxes will update the position of surrounding text, but will not 
        affect the position of surrounding block boxes. --> */
    /* <!-- An inline-block box is something in between the first two: It flows with surrounding 
        text and other inline elements without creating line breaks before and after it 
        unlike a block box, but it can be sized using width and height and maintains its 
        block integrity like a block box. It won't be broken across paragraph lines like an
         inline box. In the below example the inline-block box goes onto the 2nd line of 
         text while keeping the shape of a box as there is not enough space for it on the 
         first line, whereas inline box does break on multiple lines if there is not enough 
         space â€” it loses the shape of a box. --> */
