    <!-- Box backgrounds are made up of colors and images, stacked on top of each other 
        (background-color, background-image.) They are applied to a box and drawn under 
        that box. By default, backgrounds extend to the outer edge of the border. This is 
        often fine, but in some cases it can be annoying (what if you have a tiled 
        background image that you want to only extend to the edge of the content?) 
        This behaviour can be adjusted by setting the background-clip property on the box. -->
